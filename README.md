#This was my first project using machine learning
#I followed the tutorial to understand how get the data and analyze it using a graph. 
#Then I tested using multiple models that I knew of. I started with Linear and logistic growth, where logistic growth worked better. However, after using random forest, I got a 100% f1- score which is the best indicator of scess, thus I used this model


#Digital numbers
This was my second project using neural networks. I understood the theory behind neural networks and using the tutorial I made this project. I understood how to use the basics of tensor and am planning to make my own neural netwrok from scratch as a personal project.
