#This was my first project using machine learning
#I followed the tutorial to understand how get the data and analyze it using a graph. 
#Then I tested using multiple models that I knew of. I started with Linear and logistic growth, where logistic growth worked better. However, after using descion tree, I got a 99% f1- score which is the best indicator of scess, thus I used this model
